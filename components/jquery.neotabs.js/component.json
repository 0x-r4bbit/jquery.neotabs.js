  "readme": "# jQuery NeoTabs\n\nA flexible jQuery plugin for generating accessible tabs **AND**  tabs as dropdown inspired by\n[Dirk Ginader's Accessible-Tabs](http://github.com/ginader/Accessible-Tabs)\n\nHere are a few examples. Play with'em!\n\n* [Basic NeoTabs](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/basic-neotabs.html)\n* [NeoTabs with dropdown](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/dropdown-neotabs.html)\n* [NeoTabs with pre-activated tab](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/pre-active-neotabs.html)\n\n\n## What? Another jQuery Plugin for Accessible Tabs?\n\nYes. But it's not just another jQuery Plugin for accessible tabs. This plugin solves a problem, which isn't solved by any plugin I found in the interwebs (This is the moment you should ping me, if you know a plugin which **does** solve the problem, which is explained below).\n\n## Why NeoTabs?\nSo why did I spend the time to revamp Dirk's code from his Accessible Tabs Plugin? The reason is, I used his plugin in a project and it really does a great job! But there's one thing it doesn't cover. The Accessible-Tabs Plugin can not generate tabs, which are also able to behave like a dropdown, so that one can collapse a few tabs if there are too many of 'em.\n\nThe first thought was to take Accessible-Tabs and extend it for my needs and maybe sending a pull request on GitHub. Unfortunately it turned out, that the code isn't extendable at all. There's no way to get an instance of Accessible-Tabs or teaching the prototype new things. In addition to that, I found that the code is a bit outdated.\n\n## The Goal\n\nI've never written a jQuery Plugin before and I also never would, If I know that there's a plugin which fits to my needs. So **the goal of NeoTabs is to close this little gap** and provide a jQuery Plugin which is as accessible as Dirk Ginader's  Accessible-Tabs Plugin and is also extendable via lightweight extensions sitting on top of it.\n\n**Attention:**\nThe current version **does not** support all of Accesssible-Tabs features. This includes:\n\n- SyncHeights\n- Info texts (known as 'currentInfoText')\n- SaveState (Using Cookies)\n- Pagination\n\n## Okay got it, where can I start?\n\nEasy-peasy! Just checkout the [documentation](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js#documentation) or jump directly to the [Installation section](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js#installation) and run the [tests](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js#tests).\n\nIf you first want to see some examples, check [**them**](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js#examples) out!\n\n#### One last thing: Why \"NeoTabs\"?**\n\n'Cause they're new. yeap.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Installation\n\n\n#### Via Git\nTo get started, just [download](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js/downloads) the code from GitHub or open your beautiful CLI to do some cloning with:\n\n````\ngit clone http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js.git\n````\n\nAfter that you can either use the uncompressed version of NeoTabs, or you build a distribution version by yourself. For the latter you have to install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com) first. Please follow the install instructions from their homepage and comeback.\n\nWhen grunt is installed, move to the project directory and run:\n\n````\ngrunt build\n````\n\nThis will build a distribution version of NeoTabs. You can find it in the dist folder.\n\n#### Via Bower\n\nSince version 0.1.6 you're also able to install NeoTabs via Twitter's package manager [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower). Install it, move to your project directory and simpley call:\n\n````\nbowser install jquery.neotabs.js\n````\n\nEt voila, there's you NeoTabs plugin!\n\n\n### Usage\n\nNeoTabs sits on top of jQuery, so please include jQuery first:\n\n````\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\n    <title>jQuery NeoTabs</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n\n    <script src=path/to/jquery/source></script>\n    <script src=path/to/jquery.neotabs.js></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n````\n\nNeoTabs is built to make progressively enhanced tabbed-content. Progressively enhanced means, you start by writing well-formed and semantic markup. So, this is how it should look like:\n\n#### The Markup\n\n````\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\n    <title>jQuery NeoTabs</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n\n    <div class=tabs>\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading 2</h2>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=path/to/jquery/source></script>\n    <script src=path/to/jquery.neotabs.js></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n````\n\nEasy hah? Now to make this beautiful valid HTML5 Markup behave like a tabbed-content, all you have to do is to call the NeoTabs plugin on it.\n\n#### The JavaScript\n\n````\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\n    <title>jQuery NeoTabs</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n\n    <div class=tabs>\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading 2</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=path/to/jquery/source></script>\n    <script src=path/to/jquery.neotabs.js></script>\n    <script>\n      $('.tabs').neoTabs();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n````\nBoom. That's all. NeoTabs generates a list from your heading elements and make them behave like tabs. But what if your markup differs from the code above? No problem mucho. NeoTabs is pretty flexible when it comes to [customization](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js#options).\n\n### Generating dropdowns\n\nNeoTabs also provides a pretty simple way to let you generate not only just tabs but also tabs which behave like dropdowns, which was the original goal behind NeoTabs. So, how can you tell NeoTabs to generate a dropdown tab from a set of tabs? Take a look at the following markup:\n\n````\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\n    <title>jQuery NeoTabs</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n\n    <div class=tabs>\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading 2</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4 data-neotabs-dropdown>Tabbody Heading 3</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading 4</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=path/to/jquery/source></script>\n    <script src=path/to/jquery.neotabs.js></script>\n    <script>\n      $('.tabs').neoTabs();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n````\n\nNoticed the data attribute in the third heading element? Allright. Open your browser and take a look at the result. As you can see, NeoTabs automatically generated a dropdown tab from all tabs sitting behind the tab with the data-attribute. So you can easily say: \"I want this tabs to be a dropdown and **this** included.\". Just set the data attribute to one of your tabs.\n\n### Pre-Activating tabs\n\nSince version 0.1.1 you have the opportunity to add a data attribute to pre-activate a tab. All you have to do is to set a data-attribute. Checkout the following code:\n\n````\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=utf-8>\n    <title>jQuery NeoTabs</title>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n\n    <div class=tabs>\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4 data-neotabs-active>Tabbody Heading 2</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4 data-neotabs-dropdown>Tabbody Heading 3</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=tabbody>\n        <h4>Tabbody Heading 4</h4>\n\n        <p>Lorem Ipsum wakka wakka</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <script src=path/to/jquery/source></script>\n    <script src=path/to/jquery.neotabs.js></script>\n    <script>\n      $('.tabs').neoTabs();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n````\n\n### Options\n\nNeoTabs provides a huge list of options to customize the generated markup. The list below shows'em all up with their default values and a short description:\n\n````\n$('.tabs').neoTabs({\n  wrapperClass: 'content', // Classname of div to apply around the content\n  activeClass: 'active', // Classname to apply to active tab\n  tabHeadClass: 'tabhead', // Classname to apply to each generated tab\n  tabBodyClass: 'tabbody', // Classname which describes the body of a tab content\n  firstTabClass: 'first', // Classname to apply to the first tab of a tabs list\n  lastTabClass: 'last', // Classname to apply to the last tab of a tabs list\n  clearfixClass: 'group', // Class name for clearfix\n  tabsListClass: 'tabs-list', // Classname to apply to a tabs list\n  tabHeadElement: 'h4', // Selector which represents a tab\n  tabsPosition: 'top', // Tabs-list position 'top' || 'bottom'\n  cssClassAvailable: true, // Applying existing classes from tabHeadElement to tab\n  fx: 'show', // Collapsing effect\n  fxSpeed: 0, // Effect speed in milliseconds\n  autoAnchor: true, // Making tabs linkable or not\n  wrapInnerTabs: '', // Fragment for tab inner wrapping\n  dropdownTabLabel: '&#x25BE;', // Dropdown tab label\n  dropdownTabClass: 'dropdown', // Classname to apply to tab which represents a dropdown\n  dropdownTabsListClass: 'tabs-list', // Classname to apply to tabs list within a dropdown\n  dropdownTabsClearfixClass: 'group' // Clearfix for dropdown\n});\n````\n\n### Examples\n\nHere are a few examples. Play with'em!\n\n* [Basic NeoTabs](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/basic-neotabs.html)\n* [NeoTabs with dropdown](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/dropdown-neotabs.html)\n* [NeoTabs with pre-activated tab](http://pascalprecht.github.com/jquery.neotabs.js/examples/pre-active-neotabs.html)\n\n### Tests\n\nThis is the first time I want to try out [Vojta's](http://github.com/vojtajina) beautiful testrunner [Testacular.js](http://github.com/vojtajina/testacular). When downloading or cloning this project you can find a 'tests' folder should include all the tests.\n\n**Attention:** There are currently no tests, I'll write'em as soon as possible. Also, if you want to add unit tests, feel free to fork and send me a pull request!\n\nTo run the tests, you have to install **Testacular**. It sits on top of Node.js and Socket.io. If you're familiar with [npm](http://npm.org), this should be no problem for you. Otherwise please checkout the installations instructions of Testacular to get it installed correctly.\n\nAfter installing Testacular you can simple navigate to the project's tests folder via CLI:\n\n````\n$ cd path/to/jquery.neotabs.js/tests\n````\n\nAnd run:\n\n````\n$ testacular start\n````\n\nThis should run all the test in the command line and opens up a browser. If there are any failing tests, feel free to fix them.\n\n## Todos\n\n* Extension system (for things like jquery.neotabs.syncHeights etc.)\n* Keyboard Support\n* Paginator as an extension\n* SyncHeights as an extension\n* SaveState as an extension\n* Unit tests\n\n## Milestone\n\nThis is a first draft specification of the milestone for version 1.0.0\n\n### Public API\n\nIt should be possible to interact with an existing public API (there's already an [issue](http://github.com/PascalPrecht/jquery.neotabs.js/issues/11) for that). How does that look like? This is how you normally use NeoTabs with jQuery:\n\n````\n$('.tabs').neoTabs({\n  // ... optional options go here\n});\n````\nThis is great as long as you just want NeoTabs to rock over the markup and make your content behave like a tabs module. Anyway. It'd also be cool if you can instantiate a NeoTabs instance manually and influence it's behavior.\n\n#### Getting an instance of NeoTabs\n\nGetting an instance of a NeoTabs object is nothing special:\n\n````\n$neoTabs = new NeoTabs($('#tabs-module'), {\n  // optional options go here\n});\n````\nThis snippets does two things.\n\n* It calls the NeoTabs constructor and tranforms your foundation markup to a tabs module\n* It returns an instance of NeoTabs. This is **YOUR** gate to the public API\n\n\n#### Activating tabs\n\nOnce you have an instance, you should be able to activate a specific tab:\n\n````\n$neoTabs.activateTab(0);\n````\n\nWould active the first tab in the current NeoTabs instance, since NeoTabs starts counting from 0.\n\n#### Opening the dropdown\n\nBeing able to activate a tab is nearly the same as opening a dropdown because a dropdown is nothing more then just a tab. So opening a dropdown tab should either be possible with:\n\n````\n$neoTabs.openDropdown();\n````\nor through:\n````\n$neoTabs.activateTab(index); // where index is the index of the dropdown tab\n````\nsince it's equivalent.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis software is released under [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",
